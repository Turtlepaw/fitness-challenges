### üíª Creating a Pocketbase instance

See [Pocketbase's documentation](https://pocketbase.io/docs/) to learn how to setup pocketbase locally. All hooks are located in `/pb_hooks`, you will need to add them to your pocketbase instance for developing. [(learn more)](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-overview/)

If you need to deploy a online instance, you can create a free virtual machine using Oracle and follow [my guide](https://gist.github.com/Turtlepaw/107bf7470c94bed187db5aee6a432f3d) on how to setup pocketbase and deploy it on NGINX with Let's Encrypt.
